        "description": "Welcome to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 350 square kilometres, this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."

        "description": "The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Its habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."

Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to is a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles."

This natural phenomenon is a wonder you can't miss. Found on the picturesque eastern coast of the island, the 'Bufadero' is a fascinating sea-based blowhole in the rocks where seawater enters and exits with force, creating an impressive spectacle, as we can see in today’s image."

First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."
