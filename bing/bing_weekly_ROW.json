        "description": "Here is a beautiful coastal getaway offering endless fun and adventure—welcome to Ocean City, Maryland in the United States. Ocean City remained a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Today, it is one of the most popular vacation spots in the country, offering a plethora of activities for people of all ages. The town's iconic four-kilometre-long boardwalk is lined with restaurants, shops and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches that stretch for 16 kilometres are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. With plenty of adventure and a heritage deeply rooted in history, Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again."

        "description": "The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Its habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."

Named 'les trois tétons' by early French trappers, the Grand Teton National Park was created in 1929 by conservationists including John D. Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to is a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles."

This natural phenomenon is a wonder you can't miss. Found on the picturesque eastern coast of the island, the 'Bufadero' is a fascinating sea-based blowhole in the rocks where seawater enters and exits with force, creating an impressive spectacle, as we can see in today’s image."

First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. This lighthouse is painted white and is topped by a red cylindrical tower. This beacon's role has evolved, with automation in marking the end of the era of lighthouse keepers. A popular tourist destination, it has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. So, whether you're a lover of heritage or a seeker of picturesque landscapes, the Alfanzina lighthouse calls to you."

        "description": "Buckle up, because you are about to be whisked away on a rollercoaster ride at Nagashima Spa Land in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of the country. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."
