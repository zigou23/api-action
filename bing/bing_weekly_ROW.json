        "description": "Whale sharks have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, these gentle giants can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life."

        "description": "Perched on the edge of a basalt cliff, a town peers at the river running below. Today's image takes us to Castellfollit de la Roca in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain. This town isn't for the faint-hearted: there's a 49-metre drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia Rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."

        "description": "Today's image takes us to an icon of Parisian life: the Sacré-Cœur Basilica in the Montmartre neighbourhood. Completed in 1914, the church stands at the top of one of the highest points in Paris. It offers impressive views over the city, taking in the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, the Panthéon and much more. Designed by architect Paul Abadie, the basilica's architecture is a blend of Neo-Byzantine-Romanesque style, which might remind you of a giant wedding cake—layered and ornate. The exterior is made of white travertine stone. If you're in Paris, it's the perfect spot to soak up the beauty of the city."

        "description": "Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

        "description": "Join us as we explore Glacier National Park in Montana, United States, established in 1910. This national park has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and vast forests teeming with life, earning it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it’s a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change, who have warned that glaciers might disappear by 2030. Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elks and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image. The park's ancient cedar forests and crystalline waterfalls capture the essence of the untamed wilderness, inviting all who seek peace and adventure within its bounds."

Covering nearly 350 square kilometres, this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."
