        "description": "Slender white trunks reaching skyward and leaves fluttering even in the gentlest breeze—aspen trees are a symbol of the American wilderness. Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their autumn foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado. Aspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth."

        "description": "Today's image features a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Just a 50-minute flight from Tahiti-Faa'a, you'll find a natural paradise.  After a morning of diving in the lagoon, observing manta rays and multicoloured fish, relax on the famous Matira beach, a real jewel that looks like it was taken from a postcard."

        "description": "Framed by a natural arch in Coyote Gulch, Utah, United States, the vibrant golden cottonwood trees stand out against the colourful rock formations of the Escalante Canyon country. Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

        "description": "Amidst the landscapes of Kenya, Tsavo East National Park, seen in today's image, emerges as a sanctuary for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. Covering an expansive area of roughly 1,374,700 hectares, Tsavo East is recognised as one of the oldest and largest protected zones in the country. Here, African elephants roam in their natural splendour. These elephants, the largest land mammals, are celebrated for their extraordinary intelligence. Elephants are remarkable in guiding their young through essential skills such as finding water, selecting safe food and navigating complex social dynamics. Through gentle nudging, vocalisations and demonstrations, elephant mothers help their young survive in the wild. Whether you are capturing a splendid sunrise or exploring, Tsavo East is a place where memories are engraved into the soul, where every visit tells a new tale of the wild's untamed beauty."

World Space Week is a celebration of all the science and technology that go into exploring and researching our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change—events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing."
