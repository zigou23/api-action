        "description": "In today's image, we see the sun beginning to disappear below the pier at Huntington Beach, California, US. First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

        "description": "The lighthouse featured in today's image stands in Carvoeiro in the Algarve on the southern coast of Portugal. Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. This lighthouse is painted white and is topped by a red cylindrical tower. This beacon's role has evolved, with automation in marking the end of the era of lighthouse keepers. A popular tourist destination, it has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. So, whether you're a lover of heritage or a seeker of picturesque landscapes, the Alfanzina lighthouse calls to you."

        "description": "Buckle up, because you are about to be whisked away on a rollercoaster ride at Nagashima Spa Land in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of the country. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."

        "description": "In 1991, a Vietnamese logger stumbled upon something big in Vietnam's Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave."

        "description": "From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. As it turns out, they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image that's trekking across the arid landscape in Australia's Watarrka National Park. Its pace is deliberate, its skin a maze of spiky armour. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or Moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. It can thrive in extreme desert conditions that would be inhospitable to many. So, the next time you spot a lizard, take a moment to appreciate these cool, scaly wonders of the animal kingdom."

Telašćica Bay, on the country's Adriatic coast, is encircled by 13 islands and six islets. Featured in today's image are the bay's cliffs. They form a stunning inlet that stretches over 9 kilometres with dramatic cliffs, islets and serene bays. Locally known as the 'stene,' these cliffs reach a height of 160 metres above sea level. Other features include the Adriatic's safest and most expansive natural harbour, which has 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."
