        "description": "Join us as we explore Glacier National Park in Montana, United States, established in 1910. This national park has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and vast forests teeming with life, earning it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it’s a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change, who have warned that glaciers might disappear by 2030. Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elks and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image. The park's ancient cedar forests and crystalline waterfalls capture the essence of the untamed wilderness, inviting all who seek peace and adventure within its bounds."

        "description": "Welcome to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 350 square kilometres, this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."

Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."
