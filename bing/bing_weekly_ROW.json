        "description": "Today, we're blasting off to explore the cosmos. World Space Week is a celebration of all the science and technology that go into exploring and researching our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change—events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing."

On the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh in India, this ivory-white marble mausoleum will certainly leave an impression. The Taj, seen in today's image, was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honour his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal."

This 136-kilometre long river flows from the Philip Smith Mountains to the East Fork of the Chandalar River, winding through a valley filled with lakes and wetlands. The river begins its journey at Wind River Lake, in the Rocky Mountains near the peak of Togwotee Pass. As it flows through the rugged landscape, it collects water from various forks along the northeastern slopes of the Wind River Range in west-central Wyoming."

        "description": "There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

        "description": "What's the perfect thing to do under the midnight sun? If you're a walrus like the ones in today's image, the answer might be taking a quick dip with your crew, chowing down on clams and mussels and then sunbathing on a beach or ice floe. Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 3-metres long and weigh more than 1,179 kilograms; during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

        "description": "Covered bridges like West Cornwall Covered Bridge, pictured in today's image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability. While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance."

The national seashore is managed by the National Park Service. Established in 1971, it boasts kilometres of white sand beaches, historic fortifications and rich wildlife habitats. The seashore includes a 16-square kilometre wilderness area on Mississippi's Petit Bois and Horn Islands, protecting these regions' unique ecosystems. The Mississippi District of the seashore offers many attractions, including untouched natural beaches, historic landmarks, wildlife sanctuaries and boat-accessible islands. The National Seashore offers two developed campgrounds, one in Florida and the other in Mississippi, along with designated spots for primitive camping."
