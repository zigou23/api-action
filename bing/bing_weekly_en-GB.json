        "description": "Ever wondered what it's like to stroll through a storybook? Welcome to Glenariff Forest Park in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This park spans nearly 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares) of woodland, waterfalls and wonder, and it boasts several walking trails, each offering its own unique perspective of the landscape. The most popular is the Waterfall Walkway, a 3-mile trail that passes through a National Nature Reserve and features the Ess-na-Crub and Ess-na-Larach waterfalls. Glenariff is home to a rich diversity of wildlife including red squirrels, pine martens and badgers. Birdwatchers will be delighted by willow warblers, chiffchaffs and kingfishers. The flora is just as impressive, with trees such as the ancient beech, pictured here, oak, birch and rowan creating a lush canopy. So, whenever you choose to visit, Glenariff is sure to leave you feeling 're-leafed' and rejuvenated."

        "description": "As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were photographed in Pakistan but can also be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 38–43 centimetres, piercing yellow eyes and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 30 centimetres tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

        "description": "Sometimes it's nice to get away. Thanks to environmentalist Howard Zahniser, Americans can do that in one of the country's many wildernesses—areas sheltered from human activities. Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake is one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington, the Enchantments has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western United States. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas and numerous types of alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one."

        "description": "Welcome to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in the United States, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 87,500 acres (35,410 hectares), this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."
