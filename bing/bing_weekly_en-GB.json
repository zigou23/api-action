World Space Week is a celebration of all the science and technology that go into exploring and researching our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing."

        "description": "Today, a lyrical wave sweeps the United Kingdom—it's National Poetry Day. A tradition since 1994, it unites people from bustling cities to serene lochs in a celebration of verse on the first Thursday of every October. Founded by William Sieghart, this event aims to make poetry more visible and engaging. It's a day when Prince Charles might recite Seamus Heaney, and train announcement boards become stanzas of TS Eliot and Auden. Everyday spaces transform into stages for the spoken word—a railway station or supermarket might suddenly echo with an epic. This year the special day focuses on the theme of 'counting.' So today, our image of Loch Morlich in Cairngorms National Park, Scotland provides the perfect backdrop for finding poetic inspiration. Why not let poetry alight upon your day?"

        "description": "Nestled within the sprawling Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, United States, the Wind River lives up to its name—whipping through the rugged terrain and carving out a path that adventurers can't resist. This 85-mile river flows from the Philip Smith Mountains to the East Fork of the Chandalar River, winding through a valley filled with lakes and wetlands. Part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, this river valley is a bustling habitat for Dall sheep, moose, caribou and grizzly bears. For those who prefer their adventures with a paddle in hand, the Wind River is a waterway that offers everything from tranquil stretches ideal for soaking in the scenery to rapids that'll keep your heart racing. So, while the Wind River may sweep you off your feet, be sure to leave nothing but footprints behind."

        "description": "It's Black History Month. Originating in the United States in the 1920s, the annual celebration crossed the Atlantic to British shores in 1987—a year that also marked the 150th anniversary of Caribbean emancipation and the birth centenary of Black nationalist Marcus Garvey. The initiative was spearheaded by Ghanaian activist Akyaaba Addai-Sebo, who recognised the need for a dedicated time to reflect on Black history in Britain. This movement has since grown, and today, it's a cornerstone of our cultural calendar. From educational events and festivals to thought-provoking exhibitions, October is packed with opportunities to learn and celebrate."

        "description": "What's the perfect thing to do under the midnight sun? If you're a walrus like the ones in today's image, the answer might be taking a quick dip with your crew, chowing down on clams and mussels, and then sunbathing on a beach or ice floe. Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 3.6 metres long and weigh more than 1,180 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

        "description": "Covered bridges like West Cornwall Covered Bridge, pictured in today's image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability. While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance."
