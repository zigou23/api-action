        "description": "Every year on August 30, ocean enthusiasts come together to draw attention to whale sharks and advocate for them. These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life."

        "description": "Perched on the edge of a basalt cliff, a town peers at the river running below. Today's image takes us to Castellfollit de la Roca in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain. This town is not for the faint-hearted: there's a 49-metre drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia Rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."

More than 4,000 athletes from all around the world will meet in the French capital to compete in 22 sports across 549 different events. Delegations from 184 nations will parade down the iconic Champs-Élysées to the Place de la Concorde rather than entering a stadium. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960. Twenty-three nations took part, competing in eight sports, including wheelchair basketball and para-athletics."

        "description": "Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

Established in 1910, this national park has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and vast forests teeming with life, which earned it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it's a vital study ground for scientists who monitor climate change. Spread across approximately 1,013,000 acres (409,946 hectares), this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elks and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 700 miles of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image."

This annual carnival, now in its 58th year, began in 1966 as a small community event to ease racial tensions and celebrate Caribbean heritage. Fast forward to 2024, and it has grown into one of the largest street festivals in the world, drawing around a million visitors eager to soak up the carnival atmosphere. This year, the main action happens on August 25 and 26 when the parade takes place. However, there's an extra event, the Panorama Steel Band Competition, today. So, dust off your dancing shoes, ready your taste buds and prepare to paint the town red."
