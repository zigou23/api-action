        "description": "Grab your flippers—it's World Dolphin Day. Today, people across the world celebrate, raise awareness and promote the conservation of these aquatic mammals. Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group."

        "description": "Welcome to Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, Chile—one of the world's most remote and enchanting paradises. Famous for its iconic moai statues, this stunning island is a treasure trove of breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Experts are divided on the timeline of the Polynesians' arrival, though many researchers suggest that it occurred around the 8th century. Take in the mesmerising sunrise featured in today's image and explore the striking volcanic craters and lush, grassy plains where the imposing statues stand. The World Heritage property of Easter Island spans more than 17,000 acres (6,880 hectares), including four nearby islets."

        "description": "Today's image features the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal, which looks like a sleek line cutting through Lisbon's skyline. Up close, it is a cable-stayed bridge with viaducts, stretching across the Tagus River in Parque das Nações, a civil parish in Lisbon. The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

        "description": "Want to witness falls so grand that they make Niagara look modest? Let's explore Iguazu Falls, the largest waterfall system in the world. The name 'Iguazu' comes from words in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, which mean 'big water.' These series of waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border between Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state. They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt."

        "description": "Today, the streets of Newcastle will transform into a sea of runners, joggers and walkers all headed in one direction—south. The Great North Run, the world's largest half marathon, is back. Founded in 1981 by former Olympic 10,000-metre bronze medallist Brendan Foster, this annual event started with humble beginnings. Just over 12,000 runners took part in the inaugural race, but it quickly grew into a phenomenon. Today, the race attracts around 60,000 participants each year, from elite athletes to charity fundraisers dressed as giant bananas."

        "description": "Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."
