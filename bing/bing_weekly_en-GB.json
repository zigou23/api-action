        "description": "The lighthouse featured in today's image stands in Carvoeiro in the Algarve on the southern coast of Portugal. Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit."

        "description": "From single rails to virtual reality experiences, roller coasters have been thrilling people for centuries. Today, International Roller Coaster Day, is the perfect excuse to dive into the twists and turns of these iconic attractions. The origins of these rides can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. The first roller coaster as we know it, however, was built in the early 19th century in Paris, France. Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. Fast forward to the 1900s, which saw innovation skyrocket with coasters looping the loop for the first time."

        "description": "In 1991, a Vietnamese logger stumbled upon something big in Vietnam's Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air."

        "description": "From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. As it turns out, they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. Today, World Lizard Day, is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take the gecko, for example. These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature."

Telašćica Bay, on the country's Adriatic coast, is encircled by 13 islands and six islets. Featured in today's image are the bay's cliffs. They form a stunning inlet that stretches over 6 miles with dramatic cliffs, islets and serene bays. Locally known as the 'stene,' these cliffs reach a height of 161 metres above sea level. Other features include the Adriatic's safest and most expansive natural harbour, which has 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."

World Elephant Day, observed on August 12, is dedicated to raising awareness about the urgent challenges that these gentle giants face, like ivory trade and habitat loss. This habitat loss brings them into closer contact with humans, which can lead to serious problems for both elephants and humans."
