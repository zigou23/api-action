        "description": "Music, glitter, flavours, masquerade dancers and colourful feathers—Notting Hill Carnival is back in London. This annual carnival, now in its 58th year, began in 1966 as a small community event to ease racial tensions and celebrate Caribbean heritage. Fast forward to 2024, and it has grown into one of the largest street festivals in the world, drawing around a million visitors eager to soak up the carnival atmosphere. This year, the main action happens on August 25 and 26 when the parade takes place. However, there's an extra event, the Panorama Steel Band Competition, today. So, dust off your dancing shoes, ready your taste buds and prepare to paint the town red."

        "description": "The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Its habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."

First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and to watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."
