        "description": "If you're ever in Sweden and looking for a quiet place to get 'shelved,' the Stockholm Public Library, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals, is your spot. Opened in 1928, this library is not just a place to borrow books; it's a cultural icon and an architectural marvel. Here, more than 2 million volumes wait to unfold stories in over 100 languages. Designed by architect Erik Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s, this Nordic Classicist composition features the geometry of a cylinder intersecting a cubic base. Its accessible façade belies a treasure trove within a 360-degree rotunda, inviting even the casual reader into a literal circle of knowledge."

        "description": "If you've ever found yourself dreaming of a night packed with classical music, patriotic fervour and the occasional flag-waving, then the Last Night of the Proms, happening today, is for you. This annual event, held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, pictured here, is the grand finale of the BBC Proms season. The Proms, short for 'Promenade Concerts,' began in 1895 with the aim of making classical music accessible to everyone. It started with just a few concerts, but it has grown into a summer-long festival featuring hundreds of performances from July to September. The Last Night typically kicks off with a selection of classical favourites performed by top orchestras and soloists. Expect the second half of the evening to get properly patriotic, with anthems like 'Land of Hope and Glory' and 'Rule, Britannia!,' inspiring a joyous sing-along. So, put on your best concert attire or a flag cape and get ready to join in the fun!"

Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group."

Famous for its iconic moai statues, this stunning island is a treasure trove of breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Experts are divided on the timeline of the Polynesians' arrival, though many researchers suggest that it occurred around the 8th century. Take in the mesmerising sunrise featured in today's image and explore the striking volcanic craters and lush, grassy plains where the imposing statues stand. The World Heritage property of Easter Island spans more than 17,000 acres (6,880 hectares), including four nearby islets."

        "description": "Today's image features the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal, which looks like a sleek line cutting through Lisbon's skyline. Up close, it is a cable-stayed bridge with viaducts, stretching across the Tagus River in Parque das Nações, a civil parish in Lisbon. The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

The name 'Iguazu' comes from words in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, which mean 'big water.' These series of waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border between Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state. They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt."
