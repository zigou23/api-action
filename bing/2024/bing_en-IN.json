This lighthouse is a black, four-sided lattice tower featuring two galleries and a round lantern. Constructed between 1886 and 1887 by AG Weser for the Bremen Buoy and Beacon Office, it was part of an intergovernmental project involving the states of Bremen, Oldenburg and Prussia. Originally equipped with a Fresnel belt lamp and a 500 millimetres catadioptric reflector, it used a three-wick kerosene lamp to cast light over 19 nautical kilometres. By 1905, the lighthouse was upgraded with a more powerful kerosene lamp."

Originally constructed in 1559, this castle has witnessed centuries of Japanese history, including the rise and fall of powerful clans. It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country— but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes and hues, symbolising good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales."

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and is the most common species on North America's western coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects."

The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

The Indian rhinoceros, also known as the greater one-horned rhinoceros, is native to the Indian subcontinent. It's the second-largest living rhinoceros species, with adult males weighing between 2.07 and 2.2 tonnes and adult females around 1.6 tonnes. These rhinos are mostly solitary, coming together only during the breeding season or when raising their young."

Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for more than 340 kilometres before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. The lower stretches of the river, known as the Tideway, extend up to Teddington Lock, reflecting its extensive tidal reach. From Oxford to its estuary, the river descends 55 metres. Although the Thames flows through some of the drier regions of mainland Britain and is heavily tapped for drinking water, its discharge is relatively low compared to its size."

The whale shark holds the record as the largest fish on Earth, reaching lengths up to 12 metres, with one exceptional individual measuring a remarkable 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint."

This town is not for the faint-hearted: there's a 48-metre drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia Rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador. Although eruptions ceased some 11 millennia ago, the area is still considered seismically active. In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona more than 80 kilometres away. Today, it's a serene haven for trekkers, akin to the trails of the Western Ghats, inviting enthusiasts to explore volcanic vistas untouched by time."

These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. This creature, the largest in the alligator family, can grow to more than 6 metres and tip the scales at upwards of 450 kilograms. Their dark scales are a masterstroke of camouflage, giving them an edge in hunting a variety of aquatic and terrestrial prey. Their role extends beyond predation, however. They indirectly protect our agricultural interests by maintaining balance within their ecosystem, preventing overpopulation of species such as piranhas and capybaras, which can affect local agriculture and livestock."

Katahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear, Canada lynx and numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing."

At about 16 kilometres from Yellowstone National Park, these peaks, part of a mountain range less than 10 million years old, continue to captivate with their youthful defiance against erosion. Encompassing thriving ecosystems, the park is a sanctuary for grizzly bears, wolves and the flight of bald eagles. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago. Towering over the Jackson Hole valley and reflected in one of its many lakes, the Tetons and the park are a breathtaking sight to behold."

Lighthouses have been keeping sailors safe almost as long as humans have been sailing the seas. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships have often been used. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit."

Once known as the  White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions.

Since then, it has become a tradition for the sitting prime minister to raise the flag and deliver a national address on Independence Day. Over time, the focus of the celebration has shifted from solely nationalism to a broader appreciation of Indian culture and heritage. The Indian diaspora also celebrates this day worldwide, with parades and events, especially in areas with significant Indian populations. In New York and other US cities, it has come to be recognised as 'India Day.' Independence Day is not just a reminder of our country's journey towards independence but also the ongoing commitment to build a brighter future for all."

        "description": "From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. As it turns out, they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. Today, World Lizard Day, is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take the gecko, for example. These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature."

Telašćica Bay, on the country's Adriatic coast, is encircled by 13 islands and six islets. Featured in today's image are the bay's cliffs. They form a stunning inlet that stretches over 9 kilometres with dramatic cliffs, islets and serene bays. Locally known as the 'stene,' these cliffs reach a height of 160 metres above sea level. Other features include the Adriatic's safest and most expansive natural harbour, which has 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."

World Elephant Day, observed on August 12, is dedicated to raising awareness about the urgent challenges that these gentle giants face, like the ivory trade and habitat loss. This habitat loss brings them into closer contact with humans, which can lead to serious problems for both elephants and humans."

The wooden pathway in today's image, surrounded by ancient pine and cedar trees, leads to Kennedy Lake, the largest freshwater body on the island. The lake covers a surface area of over 64 square kilometres. It is part of the ancestral lands of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation where the Clayoquot and Kennedy Rivers meet. Tofino, over 19 kilometres away, has a real surf vibe. This small coastal town is a sanctuary for hikers, bird watchers, artists and dreamers. Famous for its mild winters and pleasant summers, it has been a filming location for movies like 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon,' and 'One Week.'"
