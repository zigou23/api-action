        "description": "Welcome to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 350 square kilometres, this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."

Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."

These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of the country. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave."

Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image that's trekking across the arid landscape in Australia's Watarrka National Park. Its pace is deliberate, its skin a maze of spiky armour. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or Moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. It can thrive in extreme desert conditions that would be inhospitable to many. So, the next time you spot a lizard, take a moment to appreciate these cool, scaly wonders of the animal kingdom."
