        "description": "In the middle of the desert, there's a garden that's anything but ordinary—Bada Bagh, visible in the distance in today's image. It is about six kilometres north of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, and is home to an impressive collection of royal chhatri cenotaphs, built by the Maharajas of Jaisalmer State from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. Meticulously carved from yellow sandstone blocks, these cenotaphs showcase the elegance of Rajasthani architecture, combining elements of Hindu and Islamic styles. Embellished with exquisite paintings, sculptures and inscriptions, these were built in four distinct sizes, each reflecting the royal hierarchy."

        "description": "Step into Munich, Bavaria, Germany, pictured here, for a celebration like no other, Oktoberfest. The culture of Bavaria is distinct from the rest of Germany, especially in rural areas where traditions, religion and language play a significant role. They take great pride in their heritage, which is reflected in the traditional attire known as tracht—lederhosen for men and dirndls for women—worn during special occasions. Known for their egalitarian and informal nature, Bavarians are famously sociable, a trait that's on full display during the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, attracting about six million visitors each year. This sociability is also evident in Bavaria's iconic beer gardens, where patrons are welcome to bring their own food while enjoying beer exclusively from the hosting brewery."

This secluded island, reachable only by ferry or small plane, offers 25 kilometres of untouched beaches and a wealth of stories. The Ocracoke Lighthouse, seen in today's image, stands out as a notable landmark. The lighthouse celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2023, making it the oldest continuously operating lighthouse in North Carolina. It boasts an 8,000-candlepower light, which can be seen up to 22 kilometres offshore."

This lighthouse is a black, four-sided lattice tower featuring two galleries and a round lantern. Constructed between 1886 and 1887 by AG Weser for the Bremen Buoy and Beacon Office, it was part of an intergovernmental project involving the states of Bremen, Oldenburg and Prussia. Originally equipped with a Fresnel belt lamp and a 500 millimetres catadioptric reflector, it used a three-wick kerosene lamp to cast light over 19 nautical kilometres. By 1905, the lighthouse was upgraded with a more powerful kerosene lamp."

        "description": "In Japan's Gifu Prefecture, Gujō Hachiman Castle stands majestically on Hachiman Mountain. Originally constructed in 1559, this castle has witnessed centuries of Japanese history, including the rise and fall of powerful clans. It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country— but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

        "description": "For many Asian cultures, the point at which the moon reaches its fullest during the harvest season marks the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival. It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes and hues, symbolising good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales."

        "description": "Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia. These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."
