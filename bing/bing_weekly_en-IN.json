        "description": "Today, let us explore the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States. It spans more than 354 square kilometres, where silence speaks through the rustling leaves and trickling streams. This area, a cornerstone of Maine's timber industry, now breathes tranquillity instead of timber clamour. Roxanne Quimby and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations. Katahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear, Canada lynx and numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing."

        "description": "Ever dreamt of a wildlife utopia straight out of an adventure novel? The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific await your journey. With landscapes that span from sunbaked terrain to lush rainforests, these islands are akin to nature's own laboratory. Tread softly on Wolf Island, and you'll find the Nazca booby—a feathered bird endemic to this region. Despite their comical moniker derived from 'bobo,' Spanish for 'fool,' due to their land-bound awkwardness, these birds are graceful in flight and a marvel to behold. The Galápagos, much like India's very own Andaman and Nicobar Islands, boasts a unique tapestry of biodiversity. Step into this arena of natural wonders where the Nazca booby thrives amidst the cliffs and seas. So, dare to answer the call of the wild?"

        "description": "Hey, wanderlust warriors, saddle up for an American adventure at Wyoming's very own outdoor marvel – the Grand Teton National Park! The Teton Range, named 'les trois tétons' by French explorers, towers over the landscape with its jagged peaks that defy time itself. At about 16 kilometres from Yellowstone National Park, these peaks, part of a mountain range less than 10 million years old, continue to captivate with their youthful defiance against erosion. Encompassing thriving ecosystems, the park is a sanctuary for grizzly bears, wolves and the flight of bald eagles. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago. Towering over the Jackson Hole valley and reflected in one of its many lakes, the Tetons and the park are a breathtaking sight to behold."

This is an annual Hindu ritual celebrated by sisters of all ages as they tie a sacred thread called a rakhi around their brothers' wrists to symbolise protection. In return, brothers traditionally promise to safeguard their sisters and often give them gifts as a token of appreciation. The celebration is observed on the last day of the Hindu lunar month of Shravana, usually in August."

First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and to watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."
