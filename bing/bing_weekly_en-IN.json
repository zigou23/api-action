        "description": "'Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.' These words by former secretary-general of the United Nations Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, this observance not only celebrates those who can read but also highlights the ongoing battle against illiteracy. With approximately 775 million people worldwide still lacking basic literacy, this day resonates powerfully within the hallowed walls of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals, featured in today's image."

        "description": "Get ready to dance and paint the town red; it's Ganesh Chaturthi. The festival honours Ganesha, revered as the Hindu deity of fresh starts and the dispeller of challenges, along with being the embodiment of wisdom and intellect. Celebrated across the Indian subcontinent, it brings together people in a joyous observance. The exact origins of the festival are not clear, but it has been a prominent public celebration in Pune since the time of King Shivaji, who ruled from 1630 to 1680. Later freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar popularised it in Maharashtra in 1893. This move aimed to foster a 'Hindu nationalist identity' and resist British colonial rule."

        "description": "As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. Not only are they a marvel with a wingspan of approximately 38–43 centimetres, but their striking yellow eyes and sharp hearing make them efficient hunters. Growing up to 61 centimetres, eagle-owls can be seen hunting by day under overcast skies. They often claim abandoned nests as their own. With breeding season spanning December to January, the eagle-owls nurture their offspring in the secure embrace of lofty trees or cliff faces. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

The Enchantments is more than 24 kilometres southwest of the charming Bavarian-themed town of Leavenworth. It's considered one of the Cascade Range's most stunning areas. The Enchantments is home to more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western United States. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas and numerous types of alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one."

The Indian rhinoceros, also known as the greater one-horned rhinoceros, is native to the Indian subcontinent. It's the second-largest living rhinoceros species, with adult males weighing between 2.07 and 2.2 tonnes and adult females around 1.6 tonnes. These rhinos are mostly solitary, coming together only during the breeding season or when raising their young."
