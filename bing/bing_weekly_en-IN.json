        "description": "Covered bridges like West Cornwall Covered Bridge, pictured in today's image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability. While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance."

The national seashore is managed by the US National Park Service. Established in 1971, it boasts kilometres of white sand beaches, historic fortifications and rich wildlife habitats. The seashore includes a 16-square kilometre wilderness area on Mississippi's Petit Bois and Horn Islands, protecting these regions' unique ecosystems. The Mississippi District of the seashore offers many attractions, including untouched natural beaches, historic landmarks, wildlife sanctuaries and boat-accessible islands. The National Seashore offers two developed campgrounds, one in Florida and the other in Mississippi, along with designated spots for primitive camping."

        "description": "Steeped in history, the Santa Maria della Salute church in Venice is a prime example of Baroque architecture. Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

Measuring 27–38 centimetres in length, these non-migratory birds use their dexterous toes to navigate branches, while their distinctive bills deftly forage for fruits, insects and small lizards."

Named after the trees that dominate the landscape, the park spans more than 1629 square kilometres and is home to wildlife such as black bears, mule deer and over 200 species of birds, including warblers, vireos and flycatchers. The giant sequoia trees here have been rooted for more than 2,200 years and are among Earth's oldest living organisms. The park's renowned General Sherman tree rises to an astonishing 83 metres. Named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, it's not only tall but is also more than 10 metres wide. Visitors flock to capture moments among these ancient giants, whose reddish-brown, fibrous bark and wide-reaching branches evoke a sense of living history."

From glaciers to waterfalls, like the one featured here today, to northern lights, this area in Vatnajökull National Park is a showcase of nature's raw beauty. Skaftafell, once a thriving farm and now a preservation area, has been formed over thousands of years by the fierce interplay of volcanic fire and glacial water. Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Vatnajökull—the second largest ice cap in Europe—stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater."

        "description": "The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 13–45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species."
