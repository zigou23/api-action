        "description": "Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia. These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

        "description": "Let's meet Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image. Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and is the most common species on North America's western coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects."

        "description": "Welcome to Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, Chile—one of the world's most remote and enchanting paradises. Famous for its iconic moai statues, this stunning island is a treasure trove of breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Experts are divided on the timeline of the Polynesians' arrival, though many researchers suggest that it occurred around the 8th century. Take in the mesmerising sunrise featured in today's image and explore the striking volcanic craters and lush, grassy plains where the imposing statues stand. The World Heritage property of Easter Island spans more than 68 square kilometres, including four nearby islets."

Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group."

This remarkable site is celebrated for its enduring essence of devotion, purity and tranquillity. Architecturally, the complex is designed according to ancient and medieval Indian architectural texts, known as the shilpa shastras. It boasts several notable attractions, including an abhishek mandap and the Sahaj Anand water show. It also has a theme garden and three immersive exhibitions: Sahajanand Darshan, which highlights core principles; Neelkanth Darshan, a film depicting Swaminarayan's early years and Sanskruti Darshan, a cultural boat."

        "description": "Today's image features the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal, which looks like a sleek line cutting through Lisbon's skyline. Up close, it is a cable-stayed bridge with viaducts, stretching across the Tagus River in Parque das Nações, a civil parish in Lisbon. The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."
