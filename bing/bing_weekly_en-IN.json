Indian athletes have consistently participated in every Summer Paralympics since 1984, although their official debut on this global stage was in 1968. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960. Twenty-three nations took part, competing in eight sports, including wheelchair basketball and para-athletics. Today's image takes us to an icon of Parisian life: the Sacré-Cœur Basilica in the Montmartre neighbourhood. Completed in 1914, the church stands at the top of one of the highest points in Paris. It offers impressive views over the city, taking in the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, the Panthéon and much more.

        "description": "Let's take a sneak peek at the black caimans of South America that's lurking in the waters of Peru's Tambopata National Reserve. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. This creature, the largest in the alligator family, can grow to more than 6 metres and tip the scales at upwards of 450 kilograms. Their dark scales are a masterstroke of camouflage, giving them an edge in hunting a variety of aquatic and terrestrial prey. Their role extends beyond predation, however. They indirectly protect our agricultural interests by maintaining balance within their ecosystem, preventing overpopulation of species such as piranhas and capybaras, which can affect local agriculture and livestock."

Spanning across a coral canvas, this refuge boasts a diverse ecosystem. Enveloped by an expansive barrier reef, you can explore three shallow lagoons and numerous islets. But wait, there's more. The lush greenery here is a bustling neighbourhood that's home to more than a million birds from 29 different species, like the masked booby, great frigatebird and sooty tern. It's also one of the few places outside the Galápagos Islands where red-footed boobies are found. A wide variety of marine wildlife is in and around the atoll, including green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles and the mighty coconut crab, the world's largest land invertebrate."

This fort once housed a vault that safeguarded some of the world's most famous gems, including the legendary Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds. The origins of the fort date back to the 11th century when it was first established as a modest mud fort by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire. It's also believed that the Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva, who reigned from 1199 to 1262, constructed a stone outpost on the hilltop to protect the empire's western frontier."

        "description": "Today, let us explore the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States. It spans more than 354 square kilometres, where silence speaks through the rustling leaves and trickling streams. This area, a cornerstone of Maine's timber industry, now breathes tranquillity instead of timber clamour. Roxanne Quimby and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations. Katahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear, Canada lynx and numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing."
