        "description": "Slender white trunks reaching skyward and leaves fluttering even in the gentlest breeze—aspen trees are a symbol of the American wilderness. Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado, USA."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

        "description": "Today's image features the Elbphilharmonie on the Grasbrook peninsula of the Elbe River in Hamburg, Germany. Designed by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, this concert hall is a modern architectural marvel perched atop an old brick warehouse from 1963. A centrepiece of the new Hafencity development, it's Hamburg's tallest inhabited building—there are 45 luxury apartments on the upper floors—reaching a height of 107 metres. The Elbphilharmonie features three concert venues: the Great Concert Hall, with vineyard-style seating for 2,100, and acoustics designed by renowned Japanese acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota; the Recital Hall, accommodating 550 for recitals, chamber music and jazz; and the Kaistudio, a 170-seat space for educational activities. This fusion of history and innovation at the Elbphilharmonie offers a glimpse into thoughtful and creative architecture."

        "description": "Framed by a natural arch in Coyote Gulch, Utah, the vibrant golden cottonwood trees stand out against the colourful rock formations of the Escalante canyon country. Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

Through gentle nudging, vocalisations and demonstrations, elephant mothers pass down vital knowledge that helps their young survive in the wild. Sadly, these precious animals face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching. As we admire these majestic creatures and strive to protect them, we can learn valuable lessons about empathy, cooperation and the importance of community."

World Space Week is a celebration of all the science and technology that go into exploring and researching our universe, and how it benefits us back on Earth. As well as helping us to understand the universe we live in, space exploration has played an important role in helping scientists develop new medicines, create new power sources and even improve farming techniques. This year's theme is Space and Climate Change; events will be held in 83 countries to celebrate the vital role that space technology plays in understanding and monitoring how Earth's climate is changing."
