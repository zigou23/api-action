        "description": "Tucked away in the highlands of Costa Rica, Los Quetzales National Park offers a kaleidoscope of lush habitats, including one that's home to the blue-throated toucanet. Measuring 27–38 centimetres in length, these non-migratory birds use their dexterous toes to navigate branches, while their distinctive bills deftly forage for fruits, insects and small lizards."

        "description": "Today's image features the giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park in California, . Named after the trees that dominate the landscape, the park spans more than 1629 square kilometres and is home to wildlife such as black bears, mule deer and over 200 species of birds, including warblers, vireos and flycatchers. The giant sequoia trees here have been rooted for more than 2,200 years and are among Earth's oldest living organisms. The park's renowned General Sherman tree rises to an astonishing 83 metres. Named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, it's not only tall but is also more than 10 metres wide. Visitors flock to capture moments among these ancient giants, whose reddish-brown, fibrous bark and wide-reaching branches evoke a sense of living history."

        "description": "In Iceland's Skaftafell, autumn isn't just a season—it's an experience. From glaciers to waterfalls, like the one featured here today, to northern lights, this area in Vatnajökull National Park is a showcase of nature's raw beauty. Skaftafell, once a thriving farm and now a preservation area, has been formed over thousands of years by the fierce interplay of volcanic fire and glacial water. Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Vatnajökull—the second largest ice cap in Europe—stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater."

        "description": "The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 13–45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species."

        "description": "In the middle of the desert, there's a garden that's anything but ordinary—Bada Bagh, visible in the distance in today's image. It is about six kilometres north of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, and is home to an impressive collection of royal chhatri cenotaphs, built by the Maharajas of Jaisalmer State from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. Meticulously carved from yellow sandstone blocks, these cenotaphs showcase the elegance of Rajasthani architecture, combining elements of Hindu and Islamic styles. Embellished with exquisite paintings, sculptures and inscriptions, these were built in four distinct sizes, each reflecting the royal hierarchy."

        "description": "Step into Munich, Bavaria, Germany, pictured here, for a celebration like no other, Oktoberfest. The culture of Bavaria is distinct from the rest of Germany, especially in rural areas where traditions, religion and language play a significant role. They take great pride in their heritage, which is reflected in the traditional attire known as tracht—lederhosen for men and dirndls for women—worn during special occasions. Known for their egalitarian and informal nature, Bavarians are famously sociable, a trait that's on full display during the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, attracting about six million visitors each year. This sociability is also evident in Bavaria's iconic beer gardens, where patrons are welcome to bring their own food while enjoying beer exclusively from the hosting brewery."

This secluded island, reachable only by ferry or small plane, offers 25 kilometres of untouched beaches and a wealth of stories. The Ocracoke Lighthouse, seen in today's image, stands out as a notable landmark. The lighthouse celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2023, making it the oldest continuously operating lighthouse in North Carolina. It boasts an 8,000-candlepower light, which can be seen up to 22 kilometres offshore."
