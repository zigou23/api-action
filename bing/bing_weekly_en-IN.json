        "description": "Raksha Bandhan's here. Are you ready with your rakhis? This is an annual Hindu ritual celebrated by sisters of all ages as they tie a sacred thread called a rakhi around their brothers' wrists to symbolise protection. In return, brothers traditionally promise to safeguard their sisters and often give them gifts as a token of appreciation. The celebration is observed on the last day of the Hindu lunar month of Shravana, usually in August."

First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and to watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

        "description": "The lighthouse featured in today's image stands in Carvoeiro in the Algarve on the southern coast of Portugal. Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also became a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. Lighthouses have been keeping sailors safe almost as long as humans have been sailing the seas. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships have often been used. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit."

        "description": "From single rails to virtual reality experiences, roller coasters have been thrilling people for centuries. The origins of these rides can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as the  White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—buckle up, take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."

        "description": "It's Independence Day, the day our nation threw off the yoke of British rule. This day commemorates the transfer of legislative sovereignty from the British crown to the Indian Constituent Assembly. Our first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the national flag at the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi on August 15, 1947. Since then, it has become a tradition for the sitting prime minister to raise the flag and deliver a national address on Independence Day. Over time, the focus of the celebration has shifted from solely nationalism to a broader appreciation of Indian culture and heritage. The Indian diaspora also celebrates this day worldwide, with parades and events, especially in areas with significant Indian populations. In New York and other US cities, it has come to be recognised as 'India Day.' Independence Day is not just a reminder of our country's journey towards independence but also the ongoing commitment to build a brighter future for all."

        "description": "From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. As it turns out, they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. Today, World Lizard Day, is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take the gecko, for example. These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature."

Telašćica Bay, on the country's Adriatic coast, is encircled by 13 islands and six islets. Featured in today's image are the bay's cliffs. They form a stunning inlet that stretches over 9 kilometres with dramatic cliffs, islets and serene bays. Locally known as the 'stene,' these cliffs reach a height of 160 metres above sea level. Other features include the Adriatic's safest and most expansive natural harbour, which has 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."
