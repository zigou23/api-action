        "description": "Covered bridges like West Cornwall Covered Bridge, pictured in today's image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability. While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance."

        "description": "National Public Lands Day takes place every fourth Saturday of September. Today is all about preserving public lands, which can be anything from national parks to urban green spaces. On this day, entry fees to many federal lands are waived, and those who participate in conservation activities like cleanups or restoring historic structures receive free entry coupons for future visits to these locations. This day has grown substantially since it began in 1994. Its first celebration was started by three national agencies and drew 700 volunteers. By 2010, the number of volunteers had increased to 170,000, spreading across more than 2,000 sites."

As a plague devastated the city in 1630, its leader, Doge Nicolò Contarini, vowed to build a majestic church dedicated to the Virgin Mary if the city was spared. In 1631 the epidemic ended, and construction began. The church, built in the Baroque style, was completed around 50 years later, a lifelong project for architect Baldassare Longhena."

        "description": "On this day in 1890, Sequoia National Park was founded in the southern Sierra Nevada to protect one of America's natural splendors. Named after the giant sequoias that dominate the landscape, the park spans more than 629 square miles and is home to wildlife such as black bears, mule deer, and over 200 species of birds, including warblers, vireos, and flycatchers . The giant sequoia trees here have been rooted for more than 2,200 years and are among Earth's oldest living organisms. The park's renowned General Sherman tree rises to an astonishing 275 feet. Named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, it's not only tall but is also more than 36 feet wide. Visitors flock to capture moments among these ancient giants, whose reddish-brown, fibrous bark and wide-reaching branches evoke a sense of living history."

        "description": "In Iceland's Skaftafell, fall isn't just a season—it's an experience. From glaciers to waterfalls, like the one featured here today, to northern lights, this area in Vatnajökull National Park is a showcase of nature's raw beauty. Skaftafell's dramatic landscape was formed over thousands of years by the fierce interplay of volcanic fire and glacial water. Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Iceland's largest ice cap Vatnajökull, stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater. Surrounded by dark lava columns resembling a heart from afar, this waterfall inspired the design of Iceland's National Theatre and the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík."

        "description": "We're celebrating Sea Otter Awareness Week with this laid-back little guy in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. They're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food and using rocks to crack open shellfish, one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 sea otters in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for their dense fur for almost two centuries. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 sea otters were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban and conservation efforts have helped them rebound in their historic habitat to an estimated 125,000. Despite this success, some populations continue to struggle, and sea otters are still an endangered species. So, unlike our homepage star, we can't relax on sea otter conservation just yet."
