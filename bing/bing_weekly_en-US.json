        "description": "Welcome to Katahdin, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 87,500 acres, this new national monument was established eight years ago today. Maine's logging industry was a big part of this region for over a hundred years but declined toward the end of the 19th century. Efforts to preserve its landscape were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She started buying land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."

Built between the 10th and 13th centuries, this remarkable site served as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance."

        "description": "Here is a beautiful coastal getaway offering endless fun and adventure—welcome to Ocean City, Maryland. Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Today, it is a popular vacation spot, with an iconic 3-mile-long boardwalk lined with restaurants, shops, and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches stretching over 10 miles are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball, or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again."

        "description": "The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanor when they're walking."

Named 'les trois tétons' by early French trappers, the park was created in 1929 by conservationists including John D. Rockefeller Jr. It is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose, and bald eagles."
