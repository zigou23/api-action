        "description": "This sleek structure is the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which appears to vanish into the horizon after crossing the Tagus River in Portugal. Stretching nearly 8 miles, it was Europe's longest bridge when it opened in 1998, built to ease traffic on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal. This cable-stayed bridge was designed to be earthquake and wind-resistant; its deck is not fixed to the pylons, and it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Its opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

These epic waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border of Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state."

        "description": "'Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.' These words by former UN chief Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, it promotes the importance of literacy as a matter of dignity and a human right. The UN estimates that at least 765 million adults worldwide cannot read and write, and millions of children are failing to learn basic literacy skills. We are marking the day with an image of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals."

        "description": "On the first Saturday in September, National Hummingbird Day celebrates these tiny, agile birds and their role as pollinators in our ecosystem. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover and fly backward. Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. These birds can remember which flowers they've visited and how long they will take to refill with nectar."

        "description": "This storybook setting is Glenariff Forest Park in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, which spans nearly 3,000 acres of woodland and waterfalls. Among its popular walking trails is the Waterfall Walkway, a 3-mile trail that passes through a national nature reserve and past the Ess-na-Crub and Ess-na-Larach waterfalls. Glenariff is home to a rich diversity of wildlife including red squirrels, pine martens, and badgers. Birdwatchers will be delighted by willow warblers, chiffchaffs, and kingfishers. The flora is just as impressive, with trees like the old beech pictured here, oaks, birches, and rowans creating a lush canopy. It's the perfect spot for a bit of soul-searching beneath ancient branches in this beautiful landscape known as the 'Queen of the Glens.'"

        "description": "As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were snapped in Pakistan and can be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."
