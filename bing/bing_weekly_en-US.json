        "description": "Build your excitement—it's World Architecture Day! Today's image features the Elbphilharmonie on the Grasbrook peninsula of the Elbe River in Hamburg, Germany. Designed by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, this concert hall is a modern architectural marvel perched atop an old brick warehouse from 1963. A centerpiece of the new Hafencity development, it's Hamburg's tallest inhabited building—there are 45 luxury apartments in the upper floors—reaching a height of 354 feet."

        "description": "Sorano is a serene medieval village perched atop a cliff in the Italian province of Grosseto, southern Tuscany. Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates back to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defense with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilization inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE."

The park, in central California's Sierra Nevada range, has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers, and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the US, with more than 3 million visitors a year."
