        "description": "Let's meet Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image. Named after Anna Masséna, Duchess of Rivoli, it's one of an estimated 366 hummingbird species, and it's the most common species on North America's western coast. With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects."

The most populous city in Canada and the capital of Ontario, it boasts a population of 2,794,356 as of 2021, making it the fourth-largest city in North America. Known for its dynamic blend of business, finance, arts, sports and culture, the city is also celebrated for its multicultural and cosmopolitan character. Indigenous peoples have inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years. Following the contentious Toronto Purchase, the British established York in 1793, which was later renamed Toronto and incorporated as a city in 1834. Geographically, Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes in surface area, spanning 19,010 square kilometres, yet it surpasses Lake Erie in volume. It's the 13th largest lake globally, with a shoreline of 1,145 kilometres."

These primarily nocturnal raptors were photographed in Pakistan but can also be found in forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 38–43 centimetres, piercing yellow eyes and exceptional hearing help them catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 61 centimetres, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. The lower stretches of the river, known as the Tideway, extend up to Teddington Lock, reflecting its extensive tidal reach. From Oxford to its estuary, the river descends 55 metres. Although the Thames flows through some of the drier regions of mainland Britain and is heavily tapped for drinking water, its discharge is relatively low compared to its size."

As the world's largest fish, these gentle giants can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life."

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

This natural phenomenon is a wonder you can't miss. Found on the picturesque eastern coast of the island, the 'Bufadero' is a fascinating sea-based blowhole in the rocks where seawater enters and exits with force, creating an impressive spectacle, as we can see in today’s image."

First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. This lighthouse is painted white and is topped by a red cylindrical tower. This beacon's role has evolved, with automation in marking the end of the era of lighthouse keepers. A popular tourist destination, it has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. So, whether you're a lover of heritage or a seeker of picturesque landscapes, the Alfanzina lighthouse calls to you."

Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of the country. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave."

With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image that's trekking across the arid landscape in Australia's Watarrka National Park. Its pace is deliberate, its skin a maze of spiky armour. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or Moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. It can thrive in extreme desert conditions that would be inhospitable to many. So, the next time you spot a lizard, take a moment to appreciate these cool, scaly wonders of the animal kingdom."

Telašćica Bay, on the country's Adriatic coast, is encircled by 13 islands and six islets. Featured in today's image are the bay's cliffs. They form a stunning inlet that stretches over 9 kilometres with dramatic cliffs, islets and serene bays. Locally known as the 'stene,' these cliffs reach a height of 160 metres above sea level. Other features include the Adriatic's safest and most expansive natural harbour, which has 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."

Tofino, over 19 kilometres away, has a real surf vibe. This small coastal town is a sanctuary for hikers, bird watchers, artists and dreamers.
