        "description": "Take a trip to Ocean City, Maryland, USA, where a beautiful coastal getaway offers endless fun and adventure. Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Now, this coastal village is known among travellers from far and wide, including us Canadians seeking sunnier climes.  The town's iconic four-kilometre-long boardwalk is lined with restaurants, shops and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches that stretch for 16 kilometres are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. With plenty of adventure and a heritage deeply rooted in history, Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again."

        "description": "The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Its habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."

        "description": "Mind-blowing beauty like the kind pictured in today's image is one reason people keep coming back to Wyoming, US, and the Grand Teton National Park. Named 'les trois tétons' by early French trappers, the Grand Teton National Park was created in 1929 by conservationists including John D. Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles."

        "description": "In Elliston, Newfoundland and Labrador, Atlantic puffins, like the ones in today's image, draw onlookers with their black and white plumage and orange beaks. As well as in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, these seabirds breed in several countries, including Russia, Iceland, Norway, and Greenland. These 'sea parrots' have a wingspan of 47 to 63 centimetres and travel vast distances to mate. Surprisingly, the colour of their beaks changes seasonally; during the breeding season, it is brighter with a hint of yellow and orange. However, in the nonbreeding season, the beak sheds its yellow highlight."

First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea."

As the sun sets, the grounds of the CNE will come alive with live performances from artists and bands like Doriann Forrester, James Naro and Kyle Layton, Sloan, and MacKenzie Porter. A lineup that spans all musical tastes, from toe-tapping country beats to electric pop rhythms—there's a song for every taste. As well as music, there's plenty more to do; go for a ride on the Century Wheel or the Berry Go Round, or take part in games like the Peewee Baseball Tournament and Girls Fastball Tournament."
