        "description": "Join us as we explore Glacier National Park in Montana, United States, established in 1910. This national park has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and vast forests teeming with life, earning it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it's a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change, who have warned that glaciers might disappear by 2030. Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elk and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image. The park's ancient cedar forests and crystalline waterfalls capture the essence of the untamed wilderness, inviting all who seek peace and adventure within its bounds."

        "description": "Welcome to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 350 square kilometres, this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."

Built between the 10th and 13th centuries, this remarkable site served as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva. It is on the rim of an extinct volcano, offering views of the surrounding paddy fields and the towering Dongrek Mountains of Cambodia in the distance."

        "description": "Take a trip to Ocean City, Maryland, USA, where a beautiful coastal getaway offers endless fun and adventure. Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Now, this coastal village is known among travellers from far and wide, including us Canadians seeking sunnier climes.  The town's iconic four-kilometre-long boardwalk is lined with restaurants, shops and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches that stretch for 16 kilometres are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. With plenty of adventure and a heritage deeply rooted in history, Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again."

        "description": "The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are a paradise for wildlife. Its habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."

Named 'les trois tétons' by early French trappers, the Grand Teton National Park was created in 1929 by conservationists including John D. Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles."

        "description": "In Elliston, Newfoundland and Labrador, Atlantic puffins, like the ones in today's image, draw onlookers with their black and white plumage and orange beaks. As well as in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, these seabirds breed in several countries, including Russia, Iceland, Norway, and Greenland. These 'sea parrots' have a wingspan of 47 to 63 centimetres and travel vast distances to mate. Surprisingly, the colour of their beaks changes seasonally; during the breeding season, it is brighter with a hint of yellow and orange. However, in the nonbreeding season, the beak sheds its yellow highlight."
