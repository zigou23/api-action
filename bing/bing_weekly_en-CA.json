        "description": "Perched on the edge of a basalt cliff, a town peers at the river running below. Today's image takes us to Castellfollit de la Roca in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain. This town isn't for the faint-hearted: there's a 50-metre drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia Rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."

        "description": "The Summer Paralympic Games get underway in Paris today. More than 4,000 athletes from all around the world will meet in the French capital to compete in 22 sports across 549 different events. Delegations from 184 nations will parade down the iconic Champs-Élysées to the Place de la Concorde rather than entering a stadium. This year, the Canadian Paralympic Team consists of 20 members that includes five Paralympic medallists, like Greg Stewart and Brent Lakatos. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960. 23 nations took part, competing in eight sports, including wheelchair basketball and para-athletics."

        "description": "Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to six metres and weighing as much as 40 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

        "description": "Join us as we explore Glacier National Park in Montana, United States, established in 1910. This national park has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and vast forests teeming with life, earning it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it's a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change, who have warned that glaciers might disappear by 2030. Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elk and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image. The park's ancient cedar forests and crystalline waterfalls capture the essence of the untamed wilderness, inviting all who seek peace and adventure within its bounds."

        "description": "Welcome to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as far as the eye can see. Covering nearly 350 square kilometres, this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."
