        "description": "Mind-blowing beauty like the kind pictured in today's image is one reason people keep coming back to Wyoming, US, and the Grand Teton National Park. Named 'les trois tétons' by early French trappers, the Grand Teton National Park was created in 1929 by conservationists including John D. Rockefeller Jr. The park is home to a virtually untouched ecosystem of plants and animals, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison, moose and bald eagles."

        "description": "In Elliston, Newfoundland and Labrador, Atlantic puffins, like the ones in today's image, draw onlookers with their black and white plumage and orange beaks. As well as in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, these seabirds breed in several countries, including Russia, Iceland, Norway, and Greenland. These 'sea parrots' have a wingspan of 47 to 63 centimetres and travel vast distances to mate. Surprisingly, the colour of their beaks changes seasonally; during the breeding season, it is brighter with a hint of yellow and orange. However, in the nonbreeding season, the beak sheds its yellow highlight."

        "description": "In today's image, we see the sun beginning to disappear below the pier at Huntington Beach, California, US. First built in 1902, Huntington Beach Pier was damaged by a storm, leading it to be rebuilt just nine years later. During the Second World War, a submarine lookout post was installed on the pier to help with the war effort. These days, it's a popular tourist spot, with visitors heading there to fish and watch surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea."

As the sun sets, the grounds of the CNE will come alive with live performances from artists and bands like Doriann Forrester, James Naro and Kyle Layton, Sloan, and MacKenzie Porter. A lineup that spans all musical tastes, from toe-tapping country beats to electric pop rhythms—there's a song for every taste. As well as music, there's plenty more to do; go for a ride on the Century Wheel or the Berry Go Round, or take part in games like the Peewee Baseball Tournament and Girls Fastball Tournament."

        "description": "In 1991, a Vietnamese logger stumbled upon something big in Vietnam's Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres."

        "description": "From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles. As it turns out, they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. Today, World Lizard Day, is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take the gecko, for example. These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature."
