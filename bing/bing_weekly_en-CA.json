        "description": "Fall in Yukon brings a calm, impressive beauty as the northern hemisphere tilts away from the sun. The leaves transition to vibrant gold, amber and crimson hues, offering a visual feast. The Ogilvie Mountains in Yukon, seen here today stand tall with their highest peak, Mount Frank Rae, reaching an elevation of more than 2,300 metres. This range was named after William Ogilvie, who was a Canadian Dominion land surveyor. Part of the Yukon Ranges, these mountains are crossed by the Dempster Highway, a route famed for its pristine views. Some of the picturesque peaks of Ogilvie Mountains are located within Tombstone Territorial Park. Wildlife, from moose to Canada lynx, roams the terrain in fall, searching for the last bounties of the season. Yukon's fall is a fleeting period, characterised by crisp air and autumn hues."

        "description": "There's a reason why famed American photographer Ansel Adams fell in love with Yosemite National Park: vistas like today's image of Half Dome. Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

        "description": "What's the perfect thing to do under the midnight sun? If you're a walrus like the ones in today's image, the answer might be taking a quick dip with your crew, chowing down on clams and mussels and then sunbathing on a beach or ice floe. Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters of Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 4 metres long and weigh more than 1,200 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

        "description": "Covered bridges like the West Cornwall Covered Bridge in Connecticut, United States, pictured in today's image, were designed with roofs and siding to protect their wooden structures from weathering, greatly increasing their durability. While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance."

        "description": "Steeped in history, the Santa Maria della Salute church in Venice is a prime example of Baroque architecture. Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."
