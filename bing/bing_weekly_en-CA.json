        "description": "'Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.' These words by former secretary-general of the United Nations Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, this observance not only celebrates those who can read but also highlights the ongoing battle against illiteracy. With approximately 775 million people worldwide still lacking basic literacy, this day resonates powerfully within the hallowed walls of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals, featured in today's image."

        "description": "Does the bird in today's image look familiar? Well, you guessed it right, it's the Anna's hummingbird. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."

        "description": "Ever wondered what it's like to stroll through a storybook? Welcome to Glenariff Forest Park in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. This park spans nearly 12 square kilometres of woodland, waterfalls and wonder, and it boasts several walking trails, each offering its own unique perspective of the landscape.

Glenariff is home to a rich diversity of wildlife including red squirrels, pine martens and badgers. Birdwatchers will be delighted by willow warblers, chiffchaffs and kingfishers. The flora is just as impressive, with trees such as the ancient beech, pictured here, oak, birch and rowan creating a lush canopy. So, whenever you choose to visit, Glenariff is sure to leave you feeling 're-leafed' and rejuvenated."

        "description": "As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were photographed in Pakistan but can also be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 48-53 centimetres, piercing yellow eyes and exceptional hearing help them catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 0.6 metres tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

        "description": "Sometimes it's nice to get away. Thanks to environmentalist Howard Zahniser, Americans can do that in one of the country's many wildernesses—areas sheltered from human activities. Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake is one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington, the Enchantments has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western United States. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas and numerous types of alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one."

        "description": "Amid the landscapes of southern Alberta, the Elbow River originates from Elbow Lake in the Canadian Rockies. The 120-kilometre-long river intricately carves its way through valleys before converging with the Bow River in Calgary, at an elevation of 1,040 metres. Along the river's course is Elbow Falls—a series of cascading waterfalls—that creates a natural spectacle. In winter, the falls transform into an icy wonderland while summer brings a rush of whitewater, which is ideal for rafting, kayaking, fishing, hiking and other recreational activities."
