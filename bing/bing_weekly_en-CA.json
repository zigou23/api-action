        "description": "Amid the landscapes of southern Alberta, the Elbow River originates from Elbow Lake in the Canadian Rockies. The 120-kilometre-long river intricately carves its way through valleys before converging with the Bow River in Calgary, at an elevation of 1,040 metres. Along the river's course is Elbow Falls—a series of cascading waterfalls—that creates a natural spectacle. In winter, the falls transform into an icy wonderland while summer brings a rush of whitewater, which is ideal for rafting, kayaking, fishing, hiking and other recreational activities."

        "description": "The River Thames in England has more than 80 islands along its course. As the longest river entirely in England, the Thames has been a silent witness to time's dance, from Roman conquests to Shakespearean dramas on its banks. Over the centuries, kings and queens have weathered its tides, with the iconic Tower of London standing sentinel along its banks. Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for 346 kilometres before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. It also flanks several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. With every ebb and flow, the Thames invites us on a journey through time, a fluid chronicle of England's enduring saga."

Today, we're exploring the area around the Tassili n'Ajjer plateau. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is famed for its rock formations and cave art. More than 15,000 ancient engravings, some dating back 12,000 years, depict scenes of daily life, hunting and mystical beings. After checking out this desert landscape, it's time to head to town."

        "description": "Every year on August 30, ocean enthusiasts come together to draw attention to whale sharks and advocate for their conservation. These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metre. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint."

        "description": "Perched on the edge of a basalt cliff, a town peers at the river running below. Today's image takes us to Castellfollit de la Roca in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain. This town isn't for the faint-hearted: there's a 50-metre drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia Rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."

        "description": "The Summer Paralympic Games get underway in Paris today. More than 4,000 athletes from all around the world will meet in the French capital to compete in 22 sports across 549 different events. Delegations from 184 nations will parade down the iconic Champs-Élysées to the Place de la Concorde rather than entering a stadium. This year, the Canadian Paralympic Team consists of 20 members that includes five Paralympic medallists, like Greg Stewart and Brent Lakatos. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960. 23 nations took part, competing in eight sports, including wheelchair basketball and para-athletics."

        "description": "Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to six metres and weighing as much as 40 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."
