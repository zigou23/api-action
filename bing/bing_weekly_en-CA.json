        "description": "Slender white trunks reaching skyward and leaves fluttering even in the gentlest breeze—aspens are a symbol of the American wilderness. These trees are the most widespread native species in North America, with Pando, located in Utah's Fishlake National Forest, being a massive quaking aspen grove. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

        "description": "Framed by a natural arch in Coyote Gulch, Utah, United States, the vibrant golden cottonwood trees stand out against the colourful rock formations of the Escalante Canyon country. Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

        "description": "Let's explore the Taj Mahal, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. On the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, this ivory-white marble mausoleum will certainly leave an impression. The Taj, seen in today's image, was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honour his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. This tomb is the centrepiece of a huge complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. This mausoleum draws inspiration from notable structures such as the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Humayun's Tomb and Shah Jahan's Jama Masjid in Delhi."
