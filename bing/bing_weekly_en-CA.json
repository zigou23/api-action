        "description": "As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests. These primarily nocturnal raptors were photographed in Pakistan but can also be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 48-53 centimetres, piercing yellow eyes and exceptional hearing help them catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 0.6 metres tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

        "description": "Sometimes it's nice to get away. Thanks to environmentalist Howard Zahniser, Americans can do that in one of the country's many wildernesses—areas sheltered from human activities. Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake is one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington, the Enchantments has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western United States. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas and numerous types of alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one."

        "description": "Amid the landscapes of southern Alberta, the Elbow River originates from Elbow Lake in the Canadian Rockies. The 120-kilometre-long river intricately carves its way through valleys before converging with the Bow River in Calgary, at an elevation of 1,040 metres. Along the river's course is Elbow Falls—a series of cascading waterfalls—that creates a natural spectacle. In winter, the falls transform into an icy wonderland while summer brings a rush of whitewater, which is ideal for rafting, kayaking, fishing, hiking and other recreational activities."

        "description": "The River Thames in England has more than 80 islands along its course. As the longest river entirely in England, the Thames has been a silent witness to time's dance, from Roman conquests to Shakespearean dramas on its banks. Over the centuries, kings and queens have weathered its tides, with the iconic Tower of London standing sentinel along its banks. Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for 346 kilometres before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. It also flanks several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. With every ebb and flow, the Thames invites us on a journey through time, a fluid chronicle of England's enduring saga."

More than 15,000 ancient engravings, some dating back 12,000 years, depict scenes of daily life, hunting and mystical beings. After checking out this desert landscape, it's time to head to town."

        "description": "Every year on August 30, ocean enthusiasts come together to draw attention to whale sharks and advocate for their conservation. These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metre. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint."
