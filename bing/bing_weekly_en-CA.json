        "description": "Grab your flippers—it's World Dolphin Day. Today, people across the world celebrate, raise awareness and promote the conservation of these aquatic mammals. Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group."

        "description": "Amidst the whispering woods and rustling leaves, you might catch a glimpse of the red fox—a creature as clever as it is charming. What truly captivates are moments like the one in today's image, which shows a tender nuzzle between a red fox mother and her kit somewhere in the Canadian countryside. With its vivid auburn coat and a bushy tail often tipped in white, this animal is a familiar sight across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Agile, adaptable and mostly nocturnal, it roams from dense forests to urban playgrounds."

        "description": "Today's image features the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal, which looks like a sleek line cutting through Lisbon's skyline. Up close, it is a cable-stayed bridge with viaducts, stretching across the Tagus River in Parque das Nações, a civil parish in Lisbon. The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

        "description": "Want to witness falls so grand that they make Niagara look modest? Let's explore Iguazu Falls, the largest waterfall system in the world. The name 'Iguazu' comes from words in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, which mean 'big water.' These series of waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border between Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state. They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt."

        "description": "'Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.' These words by former secretary-general of the United Nations Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, this observance not only celebrates those who can read but also highlights the ongoing battle against illiteracy. With approximately 775 million people worldwide still lacking basic literacy, this day resonates powerfully within the hallowed walls of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals, featured in today's image."

        "description": "Does the bird in today's image look familiar? Well, you guessed it right, it's the Anna's hummingbird. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."
